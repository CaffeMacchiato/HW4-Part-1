Brief Overview: I updated my webpage that lets a user enter a column lower bound, a column upper bound,
a row lower bound, and a row upper bound. If the user doesn't enter a valid input in any of the forms, 
then an appropriate error message will be displayed underneath the "Submit" button. ADDITIONALLY, I added 
custom form-specific error messages that will display underneath the specific form where the error is.
I couldn't figure out how to do that with my "lowerBoundLarger" messages, so I kept the function as it originally
was in HW 3. I also kept the original error messages from my "rangeValidation" function, so there can be two sets 
of messages that appear: ones specific to each form where the error is, and ones that appear below the "submit" button.
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to figure out how to make the table scrollable, so it will stretch across
the page for larger inputs (didn't fix this from HW 3). I also didn't fix the "range" issue (from -50 to 50) from HW 3.
*I thought I'd correctly implemented the table being removed when an error message is shown, regardless of how the error 
message is generated. Unfortunately, this feature seems to be broken, and I'm not sure what exactly I did wrong.
